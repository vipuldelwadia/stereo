/** Uses a BufferedInputStream to implement a Seekable.
    <p>
    The reason for this class is that the JMF mp3 parser calls
    seek() a bunch of times when the DataSource is connected.
    Without a proper implementation, the parser is unable to find
    the mpeg frame-synchs, typically blowing up while trying to 
    figure out the bitrate, sampling frequency, etc. of the stream.
    With a plain-jane BufferedInputStream and a fake implementation
    of Seekable, I got a lot of this:

</pre>
    <p>
    Note however, that the Seekable implementation is only good
    for the first buffer-ful and is only meant to get the mp3 decoder
    happy with his initial parse of the stream.  Though there's no
    attempt to force it programmatically, it is not going to work
    to stream for 20 minutes and then try to do <code>seek(0)</code>.
    Fortunately, once it is playing, the decoder does not attempt 
    to do this.
